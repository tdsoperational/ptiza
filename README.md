A keylogger written in C, its purpose being to test antiviruses to see if they intercept the logged keystrokes. designed for a windows system, with no external libs.
The code itself isn't designed to evade in any way, simply sends logged keystrokes after 2 seconds of being idle.
It's easily killable, just taskkill it.

The author (Me) is not responsible for any missuse.
As mentioned earlier, its designed to test antivirus products.

Sincerely, tdsoperational.
