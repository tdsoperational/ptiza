A keylogger written in C, its purpose being to test antiviruses to see if they intercept the logged keystrokes. Designed for a windows system, with no use of external libs.
The code itself isn't designed to evade in any way, simply sends logged keystrokes after 2 seconds of being idle.
It's easily killable, just taskkill it.

The author (Me, tdsoperational, known as tdsmental) is not responsible for any missuse.
As mentioned earlier, its designed to test antivirus products.

Sincerely, tdsoperational.
